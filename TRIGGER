[2015-12-12] 
 - I need Travis CI to start another build, the
   last one was not what I had in mind because
   it was running concurrently with two jobs
   the structure is to be synchronous, I changed
   the settings via the web UI to one.
   (i.e.) this file is temporary just to trigger a
   new build,
